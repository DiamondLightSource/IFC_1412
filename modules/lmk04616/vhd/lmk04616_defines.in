    # Data to write, returns data returned as part of last SPI transaction
    # when read
    .DATA           8
    .ADDRESS        15
    # Set to 0 to write, 1 to read
    .R_WN
    # This bit must be set to perform an SPI transaction, otherwise the SPI
    # fields .DATA, .ADDRESS, .R_WN are all ignored
    .ENABLE
    # Selects which LMK to address: 0 => SYS LMK, 1 => ACQ LMK.  The selection
    # also affects the .RESET, .SYNC, .STATUS fields.  Note that while switching
    # both RESET and SYNC are effectively set to 0, and if .ENABLE_STATUS is set
    # this may happen on any write!
    .SELECT
    # Resets selected LMK
    .RESET
    # Drives SYNC bit on LMK
    .SYNC
    # Ignored on write, returns currently selected status bits.  Note that if
    # .ENABLE_STATUS is set the status returned here will be unpredictable.
    .STATUS         2
    # If set the automatic polling of status flags will be enabled.  Note that
    # .RESET and .SYNC must be set to 0 before enabling this, and these fields
    # must not be set while this is enabled.
