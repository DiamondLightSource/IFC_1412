    # Writing to this register initiates a QSPI transaction
    COMMAND     RW
        # This is the 8-bit instruction sent at the start of every SPI exchange
        .COMMAND            8
        # If set the address will be sent after the instruction.  This can also
        # be used for small register write commands
        .SEND_ADDRESS
        # This encodes how many bits are sent from the address
        .ADDRESS_WIDTH      2
        # Number of dummy cycles after address, can be anything from 0 to 8
        .DUMMY_COUNT        4

    # If an address or auxillary data is to be sent this register should be set.
    # Bits are sent in big endian order.
    ADDRESS     RW

    # Writing to this register writes to the transmit FIFO, reading reads from
    # the receive FIFO.  In both cases the associated pointer is advanced.
