The gather-pins script in this directory was used to generate the pins and
signals file from the .NET file provided by the vendor.  Unfortunately the .NET
file is not distributable, and this script is not really in a fit state to be
used, so it is left here for future reference.

The file xcku085flva1517pkg.txt required by gather-pins can be downloaded from

... if they haven't moved it.
