    # Data to write, returns data returned as part of last SPI transaction
    # when read
    .DATA           8
    .ADDRESS        15
    # Set to 0 to write, 1 to read
    .R_WN
    # This bit must be set to perform an SPI transaction, otherwise the SPI
    # fields .DATA, .ADDRESS, .R_WN are all ignored
    .ENABLE
    # Selects which LMK to address: 0 => SYS LMK, 1 => ACQ LMK.  The selection
    # also affects the .RESET, .SYNC, .STATUS fields
    .SELECT
    # Resets selected LMK
    .RESET
    # Drives SYNC bit on LMK
    .SYNC
    # Ignored on write, returns currently selected status bits
    .STATUS         2
